8 Locators

-ID
-Name
-TagName---->just specify
-xpath
-LinkText ----> they can only be used with a link and it must have a text  (tag <a link is usually in the tag<a>)
-PartialLinkText ----> they can only be used with a link
-Css selector
-ClassName

Why do we need so many locators?
some times there be a locator with duplicate value
s0me times the developers might not provide you with all the locators

there are some important things that you should remember while selecting a locator..
if attribute value has a number in it , it is better to avoid it and use an alternative locator.

a Partial Link Test you can just a part of text , just make sure that is unique

----------------------------------
what did we learn today ?
locators in selenium help us find the webElements
id,name,className
LinkTest , partial Link test(they can only be used for <a> and it must also have some text
tagName( we just need to pass the tagName and it is going find that particular webElement
Dom--> document object model
here we have the whole code for the website

scenario:
if there are two elements with teh same attribute value what will happen?
selenium is going to get the first one it encounters.
