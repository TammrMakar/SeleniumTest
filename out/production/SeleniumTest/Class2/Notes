8 Locators
-ID
-Name
-TagName
-xpath
-LinkText ----> they can only be used with a link and it must have a text  (tag <a link is usually in the tag<a>)
-PartialLinkText ----> they can only be used with a link
-Css selector
-ClassName

Why do we need so many locators?
some times there be a locator with dupplicate value
s0me times the developers might not provide you with all the lacators

there are some important things that you should remember while selecting a locator..
if attribute value has a number in it , it is better to avoid it and use an alternative locator.
